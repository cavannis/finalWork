# Assignment-2

To aid in complexity and standardization, all physical and skill modifiers and private to prevent confusion prevent odd situations. I.E a 2 foot dwarf isn't exactly a dwarf, so the height is constant and private to keep the character standard.

An example of a future method to be implemented that would be public is eye color. This can be user picked or it could be standard depending on personal choice. If user picked, then it's not out of the way to make it public or private if the user wants a new eye color.
